# **Cube Slice VR**
## Genre
VR action / Arcade
## Platform 
PC VR & Standalone VR
## Abstract
A fast-paced VR arcade game inspired by Fruit Ninja, where players slice floating cube-based objects instead of fruits. The cubes resemble a Rubik’s Cube without a center block. In addition to slicing, players can flip (juggle) cubes using their blade to increase score potential before cutting them.
## Core Mechanics
- **Slice**:  
Players use a virtual blade to slice cubes in mid-air.
- **Flip / Juggle**:  
Gently strike a cube without slicing it will flip it upward.
- **Combo Scoring**:  
Each successful flip will increase the score earned when slicing the cube later.

### Scoring System
- Base score for slicing a cube
- Bonus multiplier based on number of flips before slicing

## Visual Style
- Clean, geometric, minimalist
- Cubes made of smaller blocks, with satisfying physical separation when sliced
- Bright visual & audio feedback for flips and high-combo cubes

## Player Experience Goals
- Intuitive VR controls
- High physical engagement
- Emphasis on skill, timing, and risk management
- Satisfying visual and audio feedback
